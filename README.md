We propose a new method to generate in-game character of the players according to their input face photo. Our method is three magnitudes faster than the previous method ([Shi et al. 2019](https://github.com/yiyuan1991/Face-to-Parameter)) and shows better robustness (especially for pose changes).

The algorithm has replaced the previous method and been applied in the game [Justice](https://n.163.com/) (One Of Chinaâ€™s Most Popular MMOs).
